- title: Building a realtime application using Django, Strawberry and GraphQL subscriptions
  speaker: Patrick Arminio
  description: >
    “I've recently needed to work on an app that required automatic updates so I decided to implement that feature using GraphQL subscriptions and [Strawberry, a GraphQL Library]](https://strawberry.rocks/) I'm building. In this talk we will do a very fast introduction on GraphQL and then doing a deep dive into subscriptions and how to use them with Django.”
