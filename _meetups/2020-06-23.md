- title: How Django was used for recording data and sample collection during a science expedition around Antarctica
  speaker: Carles Pina Estany
  description: "At short notice we had to \"build a database\" for a scientific expedition (Antarctic Circumnavigation Expedition in 2016). I considered different options, I was introduced to Django and chose to use it (initially a bit reluctantly). We did some express learning with a hard deadline: the expedition was starting.<br>I'll explain why Django was a perfect fit for this case, how we (the data manager and I) developed a system used by the scientists in the expedition, what helped us, how the system grew during the 4 months of the expedition and what the strong points of Django for our case were."

- title: "Mocks - Do's and Dont's"
  speaker: Julius Seporaitis
  description: The relationship between mocks and code maintenance and three practical/common gotchas and how to avoid them.
