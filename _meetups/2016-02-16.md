- title: PanelApp, an example of Django helping Genomics
  speaker: Antonio Rueda-Martin
  description: >
    Once you have genomic data, how do you know what is a marker of a problem?
    How would your local GP or someone at a hospital? Access to expert
    knowledge and specialists is hard in any field but within the burgeoning
    field of genomics, even harder. Django is part of our approach to solving
    this problem.
