talks:
- title: Full clean factories
  speaker: James Cooke
  description: >
    Strong tests are dependent on the code that manages their setup and create the 
    instances required for each test run. In this talk, James explore some different
    factories available for Django and how they interact with `save` and `full_clean`. 

    James is a server-side development contractor based in London. He works mainly with
    Linux, Python, vim, whiteboards and hopefully as many excellent people as possible.

    django-perf-rec is a tool we developed at YPlan for performance regression testing in
    Django. At the PyCon UK sprints this year Adam had the opportunity to open source it,
    so now you can use it too! This talk will serve as a brief introduction into what it
    does and how we use it.

    been working with Django for 3 and a half years.
