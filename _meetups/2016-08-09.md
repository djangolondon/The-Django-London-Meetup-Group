- title: Sharing Files Securely with Korra
  speaker: Daniel Quinn
  description: >
    Back when he worked for the government, Daniel was struck by the fact that
    even an elaborate institution like his employer had no safe means of
    transferring files. Instead, would-be secure documents were emailed from
    person to person, unencrypted, across public networks because there was no
    viable alternative for those involved.

    This gave rise to a quick & dirty way to make file sharing safer whilst
    still not requiring non-technical users to understand or install complex
    software. Korra is a simple Django-based web service that employs symmetric
    encryption and makes sharing files securely easy for everyone.
