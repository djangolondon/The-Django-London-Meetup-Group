- title: Django Performance Recipes
  speaker: Jon Atkinson
  description: >
    I've written a lot of Django code in my career, some slow, and some fast;
    my aim is to share a few of the techniques you can use to go from 300ms
    response times to 30ms. We'll travel up and down the stack, looking to
    identify, monitor and solve performance issues, while dodging those which
    just aren't worth solving.
