  description: "Full-Text Search is an old problem. There are many solutions: the classic SQL LIKE statement, external search index, 3rd party SaaS, PostgreSQL’s trigram…<br>This talk will go through the difference between the various approaches, providing elements to identify which one is the best for each case.<br>About Marco: I have been working in web development since 2010, mostly with Django. Originally Italian I've been based in London for 5 years now, where I work as Lead Developer for We Got Pop and I co-organise the Django London Meetup."
