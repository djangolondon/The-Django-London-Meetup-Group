talks:
- title: Data transparency on Django with yourData
  speaker: Matthew Linares
  description: yourData is an open-source project to develop data transparency features for websites with content personalisation. For example, if a given content-stream element is rendered on the basis of a user’s personal data, we seek to display, on the element, what data is in use to the user. The aim is to improve online transparency, trust and data fluency.<br>In this talk I will outline the project’s ambition to create patterns applicable to Django and other frameworks.<br>I will then showcase how we are implementing this on our own Wagtail Django site.

- title: Hiring a Personal Investigator for your app
  speaker: Emanuil Tolev
  description: This is an intro to Application Performance Monitoring (APM). We'll talk a bit about the history of APM, look through a quick case study and walk through a simple vendor-agnostic approach to choosing an APM solution.
