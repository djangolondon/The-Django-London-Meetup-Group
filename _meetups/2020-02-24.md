- title: Which Python
  speaker: Joanna Stadnik
  description: Have you ever felt like python virtual environments were something that just happened to you?<br>You pasted and ran the commands hoping it will just work, and tried to forget the trauma and confusion immediately after?<br>Having witnessed many a new developer (including myself) struggling with a python installation that just doesn't quite want to work, I have collected a few nuggets of knowledge and understanding that have helped me make the experience this little bit smoother. In the talk, we will answer such important questions as "What is a .bash_profile/.bashrc?", "What is a PATH?", "Why do I even need a virtual environment?", and, most importantly, "Which python???".
