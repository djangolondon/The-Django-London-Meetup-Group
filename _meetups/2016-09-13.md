- title: Scaling task processing with Celery
  speaker: Viren Rajput
  description: >
    (Unfortunately this talk was postponed due to ill health.)

    Earthmiles have been using Celery in their production environment for over a year
    now, for performing variety of periodic and scheduled tasks.  It processes 200,000
    tasks per day. These include sending notifications, emails, 3rd party API calls to
    complex DB operations. In this talk, Viren will tell us about the things he learned
    from his experiences during the development phase.

    Viren Rajput is co-founder at Earthmiles. Have been developing with Python for 6 years.
    In his free time, he contributes to open source libraries in Python.

- title: Using type checking in Django projects with mypy
  speaker: Daniel Moisset
  description: >
    Python has always been one of the most dynamic languages, and that's the most important factor in
    making it as flexible and expressive as it is. However, some recent efforts being done to also bring
    the world of static typing into Python, initially as a 3rd party project called mypy, and currently with
    some support in the core language in the form of PEP-484. From some experiences with it, mypy improved
    Daniel's Python code, but its main blocker now is supporting the libraries and frameworks we all use.
    He is currently working on bringing support for Django to be able to have type annotations in web development
    projects. This talk will describe the status of this work, what could be improved, and how it can already
    make your web development better.
