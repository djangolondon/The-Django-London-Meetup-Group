- title: How Docker and Django Meet for a Tango
  speaker: Hendrik Frentrup
  description: Making development and production environments play nice together can be a real challenge. Docker and Django offer some neat functionality on both ends to make the process smoother and boost productivity. Weâ€™ll be putting the individual pieces together nicely to build what looks like a neatly dockerised Django app - from making Django use environment variables to speak to containerised services all the way to the minefield that is logging.
