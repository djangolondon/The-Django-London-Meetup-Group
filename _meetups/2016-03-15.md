- title: Intro to Paperless
  speaker: Daniel Quinn
  description: >
    After fighting with the process of applying for a UK visa and starting a
    company here, I wrote Paperless to help deal with the antiquated process of
    archiving probably-useless-but-just-maybe- useful documents using a simple
    documents scanner, Django, and a bunch of other handy utilities. The result
    is a web-based, self-hosted archive for all of your paper stuff. Scan it
    and shred it, you never need to deal with paper again.
