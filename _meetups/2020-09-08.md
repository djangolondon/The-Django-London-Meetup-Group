- title: Building lightning-fast asynchronous APIs with FastAPI
  speaker: Erry Kostala
  description: "Python 3 has brought on asyncio but there are still not many modules out there using it. One of the most ambitious and well-made python3 projects is FastAPI - A self-documenting, lightning-fast MVC framework that uses asyncio and python types to help developers build quickly and make APIs that keep performing as the project grows. I'm not a contributor to the project but I have used it in my previous job and loved it, and would love to spread the word as it's still not that well-known and it's growing!<br>About Erry: Senior software engineer, working for a company to save the NHS Â£1 billion!"

- title: How I learned to stop worrying and love testing
  speaker: Gabriela Valle
  description: "Originally developed as a training session to junior and mid-level developers at Gabriela's company, this talk covers automated testing, TDD, the benefits of testing, the different types of tests, and common mistakes.<br>About Gabriela: A 24 yo London-based mad but enthusiastic brazilian programmer. Working in the IT industry for 3+ years with distributed systems and always hands-on with Python/Django.
